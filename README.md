## Introduction

In today's connected automotive landscape, vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data that often remain underutilized. Our project bridges the gap between data and actionable insights by introducing a comprehensive vehicle predictive maintenance system. It aims to:

- **Optimize Maintenance**: Proactively predict maintenance needs.
- **Improve Fuel Efficiency**: Analyze and reduce CO2 emissions.
- **Encourage Safer Driving**: Provide insights into driver behavior.
- **Enhance User Interaction**: Enable a chatbot to answer queries using vehicle manuals.

---

## Problem Statement

While vehicles generate extensive data through sensors and onboard diagnostics, there is a lack of tools to convert this data into meaningful insights. Vehicle manuals, a critical resource for understanding and maintaining vehicles, are often lengthy, technical, and inaccessible during emergencies. This project addresses these gaps with predictive analysis and intuitive chatbot support.

## Features

1. **Predictive Maintenance**
   - Leverages XGBoost to analyze 50,000+ vehicle records for predicting maintenance requirements.
   - Features analyzed include vehicle model, fuel type, transmission type, mileage, and more.
   - Outputs actionable maintenance alerts and insights.

2. **CO2 Emission Prediction**
   - Utilizes Linear Regression to model relationships between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
   - Datasets include fuel efficiency and emission metrics for 1,067 vehicles.
   - Provides interpretable and efficient predictions.

3. **Driver Behavior Analysis**
   - Analyzes accelerometer and gyroscope data using Random Forest to score driving behavior.
   - Metrics include acceleration patterns, sharp turns, and braking intensity.

4. **Vehicle Manual Query Chatbot**
   - Combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-4 for intuitive responses.
   - Uses FAISS to index and retrieve relevant manual sections.
   - Processes and parses vehicle manuals for fast and accurate answers.

5. **Personalized Vehicle Maintenance Chatbot**
   - Uses OpenAI’s API for conversational and context-aware support.
   - Focuses on vehicle maintenance-related queries with a user-friendly React interface.
